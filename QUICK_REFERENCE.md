# Quick Animation Reference Guide

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Core Animation Features
✅ **Scroll-triggered animations** - All sections fade and slide in as you scroll
✅ **Parallax effects** - Background elements move at different speeds
✅ **3D transformations** - Hero image responds to mouse movement
✅ **Hover animations** - Cards lift, rotate, glow on hover
✅ **Click interactions** - Buttons scale, can add ripple effects
✅ **Floating shapes** - Animated background gradients
✅ **Progress bars** - Animated skill proficiency bars
✅ **Counters** - Numbers count up with spring physics
✅ **Scroll progress** - Top bar shows page scroll progress
✅ **Staggered entrances** - Elements cascade in sequentially
✅ **Micro-interactions** - Icons rotate, badges pop, smooth transitions
