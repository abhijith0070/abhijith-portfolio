# Portfolio Animations Documentation

## Overview
This portfolio now features smooth, modern animations powered by **Framer Motion**. All animations are optimized for performance, mobile-friendly, and accessible.

## Animation Features Implemented

### 1. **Scroll-Based Animations**
- All sections fade in and slide up as you scroll
- Uses `whileInView` for viewport detection
- Animations trigger only once (`viewport={{ once: true }}`) for better performance
- Staggered animations for lists and grids

### 2. **Hero Section**
**Animations:**
- Profile image: Scale-in animation on load + hover scale effect
- Name & title: Slide-in from right
- Social icons: Rotate and scale on hover, tap feedback
- Download CV button: Scale on hover and tap
- Contact button: Scale on hover and tap

**Interactions:**
- Image hovers smoothly
- Social circles rotate slightly on hover
- All buttons have satisfying click feedback

### 3. **About Section**
**Animations:**
- Section title fades in from below
- Description text appears with delay
- Interest cards stagger in one after another
- Cards lift up on hover with smooth transition

**Interactions:**
- Cards float up when hovered
- Smooth scale effect on hover

### 4. **Skills Section**
**Animations:**
- Section title fades in
- Skill cards stagger in with delay
- Individual skill badges animate in with cascade effect
- Cards lift and scale on hover

**Interactions:**
- Each skill badge scales on hover
- Cards have lift effect on hover
- Tap feedback on badges

### 5. **Projects Section**
**Animations:**
- Section title fades in
- Project cards stagger in
- External link icon rotates on hover
- Tech badges cascade in
- Cards lift with 3D-like effect on hover

**Interactions:**
- Cards float up and slightly rotate on hover
- External link icon spins 45° on hover
- Tech badges scale and lift on hover

### 6. **Experience Section**
**Animations:**
- Internship card fades and slides in
- Volunteer & Languages cards stagger in
- List items slide in from left with delay
- Certification and achievement bullets pulse continuously
- Cards lift on hover

**Interactions:**
- All cards have smooth hover lift
- List items slide right on hover
- Pulsing dots draw attention to items

### 7. **Contact Section**
**Animations:**
- Section title fades in
- Contact info slides in from left
- Contact form slides in from right
- Form fields cascade in with delays
- Links slide right on hover

**Interactions:**
- Contact links scale and slide on hover
- Form fields animate in sequentially
- Submit button scales on hover and tap

### 8. **Navbar**
**Animations:**
- Navbar slides down from top on page load
- Nav items cascade in with stagger
- Logo rotates slightly on hover
- Underline effect appears on nav link hover
- Mobile menu slides down smoothly

**Interactions:**
- Nav links bounce up slightly on hover
- Animated underline appears on hover
- Mobile menu has smooth accordion effect
- Logo scales and rotates on hover

## Animation Variants (lib/animations.ts)

### Available Variants:
1. **fadeInUp** - Fades in and moves up from below
2. **fadeIn** - Simple opacity fade
3. **slideInLeft** - Slides in from left
4. **slideInRight** - Slides in from right
5. **scaleIn** - Scales up from small size
6. **staggerContainer** - Container for staggered children
7. **hoverScale** - Standard hover scale effect
8. **hoverLift** - Hover lift up effect
9. **tapScale** - Tap/click feedback

### Easing Functions:
- Custom cubic-bezier: `[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]` for smooth, natural motion
- "easeOut" for fades
- "easeInOut" for taps

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Viewport Detection**: Animations trigger only when elements are visible
2. **Once Property**: Animations play once to reduce re-renders
3. **Hardware Acceleration**: Using transform and opacity for GPU acceleration
4. **Reduced Motion**: All animations respect user's motion preferences
5. **Optimized Stagger**: Stagger delays are minimal (0.1s children, 0.05s items)

## Mobile Responsiveness

- All animations work seamlessly on mobile devices
- Touch interactions have proper tap feedback
- No heavy animations that could cause jank on slower devices
- Reduced animation complexity on smaller viewports

## Accessibility

- Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting
- All interactive elements maintain proper focus states
- Animations don't interfere with screen readers
- Sufficient contrast maintained during all animation states

## Browser Compatibility

- Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- No JavaScript errors if animations fail to load

## Usage Tips

### Adding New Animations:
1. Import motion from framer-motion
2. Import desired variants from @/lib/animations
3. Replace HTML elements with motion equivalents (div → motion.div)
4. Add variants, initial, animate, and whileInView props

### Example:
```tsx
<motion.div
  variants={fadeInUp}
  initial="hidden"
  whileInView="visible"
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
>
  Your content here
</motion.div>
```

## Animation Timing

- **Section titles**: 0.6s duration
- **Cards/Items**: 0.6s duration with stagger
- **Hover effects**: 0.3s duration
- **Tap effects**: 0.1s duration
- **Stagger delays**: 0.1s between items

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for even more dynamic feel:
- Parallax scrolling backgrounds
- Scroll progress indicator
- Page transition animations
- Animated statistics/counters
- Particle effects on hero section
- Animated SVG icons
- Cursor trail effects

## Dependencies

- `framer-motion`: ^11.x.x - Main animation library
- React 18+ for optimal performance

**Note**: All animations are production-ready and optimized for the best user experience!
